# April


It is with great sadness that we have to report the death of the initiator, Prof.Dr.med Tilman Mischkowsky. He died after a short, serious illness on April 17, 2021. He has contributed immensely to this project. We will always honor his memory.


# February

Device is completed. We are currently preparing the shipment - challenging because of customs formalities - of 17 devices to Lebanon. Each one will be subjected to critical inspection to then become be the basis for mass production in the factory on site.

We are now in weekly contact with Lebanon, where we have a very knowledgeable PhD biologists there as interlocutors, the cooperation with her is extremely gratifying. So in this respect we are slowly but decisively making progress.

What is really difficult is the development of an instruction manual. When you consider that a package insert for a simple and practically harmless headache medication is six pages long, it is very understandable that such documentation for our device probably has to have 600 pages if it is to withstand the critical gaze of TÜV Süd. And this is, of course, the condition for entering actual mass production.

Due to a lack of our own qualifications, we need external and, by the way, also very expensive support for this, - and this will certainly take another 3-4 weeks until it is ready. We would like to accelerate this to the best of our ability, but we are simply externally determined in this respect.


# November 
The sample has arrived in Lebanon, it has already passed customs, then production preparations can start there.  In about two or three weeks, the first 0-series specimens will be shipped, including the necessary documentation. We are initially thinking of India, but are of course also open to other regions, where - as in the past - the extremely close connection to the BMZ is necessary.

If the need in Europe and in South America, and probably also in Africa, continues to increase to the extent feared, we will probably experience completely different challenges, not only for us, but also for our equipment.


# September
The technical perfection of our device by Frank Scholz and his entire team developed into a huge task. As is so often the case, the first 90% of such a device is relatively easy to construct, the perfection for the remaining 10% takes 90% of the commitment.

The focus of the further development was essentially on safety elements; at no point did we forget that our device will be effective on people who, because they are under anesthesia or deeply sedated, cannot defend themselves against possible errors. Of course, this means that we take on an enormous responsibility; we are always aware of this and take appropriate care.

All of this requires a high level of technical understanding, tremendous care and a fair amount of self-criticism. Two devices are currently at TÜV Süd, which has its own department for testing ventilators. The most difficult tests have already been passed, the remaining tests are much easier to pass, and we expect to master them easily with perhaps some marginal change requests that we can then easily fulfill. The TÜV is very sympathetic to our project.

Parallel to the final inspection by the TÜV, preparations for series production will begin in Lebanon. At the same time, we will initiate the same procedure, i.e. sending a device and the necessary production documents to Turkey and India.

One criterion that still has to be overcome is the local approval of the device in our partner countries. In Germany, we are currently experiencing the tremendous impairment of our normal lives by the virus; in our partner countries, the need is even greater. We hope that this recognizable need will make the formal and regulatory obstacles to the use of the device easier to overcome than before. Our partner in Lebanon has a large and resilient network.
